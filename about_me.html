    <h1>Kaiyuan Hu</h1>

    <p>I took a trip to Japan in around 3-4 years ago, visiting my 
        undergraduate roommate living in Osaka. During the trip, 
        I visited Osaka, Chiba, and Kyoto. I enjoyed food, such as ramen, 
        takoyaki, etc.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>A cat named Milk Tea</li>
        <li>A dog named Sausage</li>
        <li>A fish named Shark</li>
    </ul>

    <p>My favorite restaurant is Shake Shack, because I love their burgers
        with mushrooms.</p>

        <p>I absolutely love Biangbiang Mian. I like to stir it and add more chili
        sauce with it. <br> It is one of those comfort foods that always makes 
        me feel at home.</p>
